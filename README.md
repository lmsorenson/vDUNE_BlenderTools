# Steps
1. ## Update your PATH variable.
Add blender executable directory to your path variable.
(This should be the directory where the blender executable is stored.
You can check the following directories to see if the executable can be found there,
but make sure that the version number is correct if the version number is in the directory path)  
>Windows: C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.2/  
>Mac: /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/  


Once you clone this repo, you might consider adding the location of this repository to the path as well.
